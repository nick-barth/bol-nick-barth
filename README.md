Thanks for the assignment folks, it was quite enjoyable.

I think I've spent enough time on this, I believe it will be enough to guage my skills as a developer.

Several differences exist between this test project, and what I would've done in a real project, but I'm sure you're going to ask me about them! So I won't spoil it here.

Things I decided not to do:  
* Typescript - not a lot of typing to do here.   
* Storing Items Locally - would've just saved the selectedItems array to localstorage and pulled it every new page load.    
* Use Sass/Less/CSSModules - Small enough that BEM was sufficient.   
* Responsive - This menu would likely be hidden on mobile, but in any event it is responsive.  
build setup - I used CRA.
